# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my journey as a web developer.

I got interested in coding after a programmer friend of mine told me that I could learn to code, as long as I had the time.
Like many people I though you had to have a science degree or be a math wiz to be a web developer. I was wrong, so the seed was planted.
It was December the 17th, 2020. I did a lot of research and started getting an idea of what I had to do to get started.
